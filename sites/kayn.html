                "INNATE: Kayn has a secondary experience bar that tracks progress toward his Darkin and Shadow Assassin forms. He gathers orbs from champion takedowns and each instance of damage (excluding damage over time) dealt against champions. Once he has earned enough orbs, he unlocks a form based on whether he earned more from melee or ranged champions (for Darkin Darkin and Shadow Assassin Shadow Assassin, respectively), with the other form unlocked later.
                
                Kayn can move near the summoning platform to transform over 6 seconds, restoring to full health and mana and becoming invulnerable, untargetable, and unable to act for the duration. Kayn cannot choose a form if he is unable to cast abilities. The transformation will grant a passive bonus and permanently empower some of Kayn's abilities based on the form chosen. He gains a one-time Homeguard once the transformation is complete.
                
                SHADOW ASSASSIN BONUS: If Kayn has been out of combat with enemy champions for over 8 seconds, or he casts Umbral Trespass, he deals 15% âˆ’ 45% (based on level) of post-mitigation damage dealt against enemy champions as bonus magic damage, lasting for 3 seconds upon entering combat and also applying on the first instance of damage dealt. If this effect is ready, it will not be lost by taking damage.
                
                DARKIN BONUS: Rhaast heals for 25% of the post-mitigation physical damage that he deals to enemy champions with his abilities.">

Umbral Trespass can be recast after 0.75 seconds during the channel, and does so automatically after the duration or if it is interrupted.

                SHADOW ASSASSIN BONUS: Umbral Trespass gains 200 bonus cast range and emerge range. Additionally, emerging will reset The Darkin Scythe's cooldown.

          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              Kayn is very weak without a transformation and the number of junglers he can confidently duel at Scuttler
              during the early game is very small. To get a transformation, Kayn has to damage an enemy champion to obtain
              Darkin Scythe passive stacks. Damaging melee champions grants him the Rhaast Kayn transformation stacks. 
              On the other hand, doing damage to ranged champions grants him the Shadow Assassin Kayn transformation stacks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              It is important to pre-plan your jungle route so that you can path towards the lane with enemy champions that 
              you need to damage for the transformation of your choice.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              <strong>Reaping Slash</strong> can be used to jump over quite a few walls and when it is combined with <strong>Shadow Step</strong>, 
              their proper use makes Kayn a high mobility champion with a lot of easy ways to control team fights and steal jungle objectives.            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              <strong>Umbral Trespass</strong> is Kayn's most valuable spell. With proper timing it can be used to quickly dodge enemy skill shots, 
              and it is worth noting that it is possible to cast Smite while you're inside an enemyâ€” allowing for easy Baron & Dragon steals.
