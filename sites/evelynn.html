                Attacking or casting abilities ends Demon Shade immediately and places it on a 4-second static cooldown, reduced to 1.25 seconds from casting Last Caress. 
                Taking damage from champions or turrets interrupts Demon Shade and places it on a 1.5-second static cooldown.

                DEMON SHADE: While below 250 − 590 (based on level) (+ 250% AP) health, Evelynn heals herself for 15 − 150 (based on level) every second. From level 6 onward, Demon Shade also grants camouflage.">

                Hate Spike's recast prioritizes targeting Evelynn's attack target, then the nearest enemy champion, then the nearest non-champion.

                Expunging a target will refund Allure's mana cost. If the target is cursed for at least 2.5 seconds, the expunge also charms them for a few seconds and the duration of the slow is increased to last for this time, as well as applying additional effects based on the target type.
                Against champions, the expunge also inflicts magic resistance reduction for 4 seconds.
                Against monsters, the expunge deals bonus magic damage and the charm lasts 2 seconds longer.

            <p>
              Evelynn is able to know when she has been spotted due to the glowing yellow eye over nearby enemy champions and changes to her 
              stealth circle.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              Every Evelynn player will want to focus on power farming until level six as that is when Evelynn gains her much needed ultimate 
              and the previously mentioned stealth mechanic. Evelynn's early game is very weak, and her gank capabilities are close to 
              non-existent unless the enemy is heavily over-extending.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              Evelynn is very simple to gank with— utilize her stealth to get close to the enemy and cast <strong>Allure</strong> & wait for 
              the heart to fill up. Cast <strong>Hate Spike</strong> as this will charm the enemy to walk towards you, 
              keep spamming <strong>Hate Spike</strong> while also using <strong>Whiplash</strong> 
              to deal tremendous amounts of damage. Most enemies at this point have very low life, and this is when Evelynn can finish 
              off the enemy with ease by using her ultimate <strong>Last Caress</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              <strong>Last Caress</strong> does bonus damage to Baron and Dragon when they are below 30% health, this allows Evelynn to 
              secure objectives with ease by timing <strong>Last Caress</strong> and Smite properly.
