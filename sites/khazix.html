            <p>
              Isolation is a unique passive only seen by Kha'Zix. Enemies will display a circle around them when 
              they are not near any other champion, monster or minion. Isolated enemies take 110% bonus damage from Kha'Zix's 
              <strong>Taste Their Fear</strong> which means that most squishy champions have half of their HP deleted by just one cast.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              <strong>Unseen Threat</strong> can be reset with the use of <strong>Void Assault</strong>, 
              allowing Kha'Zix to slow the enemy multiple times with basic attacks.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              Never use <strong>Leap</strong> to engage fights. Use <strong>Void Assault</strong> instead, and keep 
              <strong>Leap</strong> to gap close if the enemy flashes or for running away if you're taking too many hits.           
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="tip">
            <p>
              Kha'Zix has an easy combo: <strong>Void Assault</strong>, auto attack the enemy and quickly <strong>Taste Their Fear</strong>, 
              <strong>Void Spike</strong> to heal up while slowing them and <strong>Taste Their Fea</strong>r again. 
              This allows you to keep one cast of <strong>Void Assault</strong> and <strong>Leap</strong> in case of an emergency.
